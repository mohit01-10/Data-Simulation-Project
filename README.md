# Data-Simulation-Project
This repository contains the source code for my Rocket Flight Simulation project. The project is built using Python and leverages the tkinter module for real-time visualization, incorporating libraries such as Tkinter, Matplotlib, and Plotly to simulate and visualize rocket flight data in action.
Data:
1. Flight duration
2. Velocity
3. Height
4. Trajectory 
5. Accleartion( Displaayed on the console)

I built this project to simulate the flight of a rocket, taking into account various physical factors. It offers real-time visualization of rocket velocity, altitude, and trajectory. 

Feel free to clone this repository, explore the code, and provide feedback or contributions. I welcome collaboration and the opportunity to learn and grow as a developer.
